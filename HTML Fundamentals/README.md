## What is HTML? HTML: (hypertext markup language) It is a markup language, markup is not displayed but rather instructions on how it should display on the browser. Browser interprets the markup and then renders the document. Hypertext means it goes beyond simple text

## Hypertext Transport Protocol: method which we exchange html documents, they need to use http to request documents and view it in their browser

## Universal Resource Locator: (URI/URL) Addresses/universal resource identifier/locator. In the address it can identify the server where the document resides and information on how to access the document

DOCTYPE: What type of HTML document are we looking at and what the content is.

HTML Element: root container of all the content inside the document. (<html></html>)
Head Element: contains document metadata.
Body Element: contains the content to be displayed.

## Head has 6 child elements: 

- \<title\>:  provides title for the page and displayed in title bar
- \<meta\>: provides metadata for the document (viewport, keywords and info for searches)
- \<script\>: provide right inside the document some script or code to make pages more interactive
- \<style\>: allows provide styles or info on how to render certain content typically applied with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- \<link\>: provide links to different types of resources
